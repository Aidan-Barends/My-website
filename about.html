                <h2 class="h2">Goals and Aspirations</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    As I continue my journey in the IT field, my primary goal is to become a full-stack developer, 
                    combining front-end and back-end skills to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications. 
                    I am also passionate about cybersecurity, and I aim to explore how secure coding practices can integrate seamlessly with software development. 
                    Learning and applying the principles of cloud computing and mobile app development are part of my longer-term vision, 
                    as I believe these areas are critical to the future of software development. 
                    In the short term, I want to gain hands-on experience by working on real-world projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve complex problems. 
                    I’m particularly eager to work with agile teams where collaboration and innovative thinking are encouraged. 
                    Eventually, I see myself taking on a leadership role, where I can guide development teams and contribute to larger, impactful projects that make a difference.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2">Personal Interests</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am an avid problem-solver who loves tackling challenges in new and creative ways. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy coding small projects to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. 
                    I’m also fascinated by ethical hacking and cybersecurity puzzles, which allow me to sharpen my critical thinking and analysis skills. 
                    When I’m not immersed in tech, I find joy in outdoor adventures, from hiking to exploring new places, as these activities help me stay energized and inspired. 
                    I also engage in community work, particularly with local initiatives that focus on education and tech literacy, as I believe in giving back and empowering others through knowledge.
